The wife and I have a son and, at the time of this writing, he's 14 months old.  Of all the things I've had a hand in creating; I don't think a single application, cli, database or ui can compare to him.  It's all hugs and kisses, food, tickling, baths, naps, books, singing and changin diapers. Our interaction is simple and anything but demanding when compared to the strains and stress of developing software.

Now as a developer, husband and father I've found that I'm have even more things to trade for my time.

At first, before the wife and before the child, all the hours in the day were mine. I spent time working, spent time socializing with friends and spent time enjoing my hobbies. In reflection, I would say there was even some time I wasted. I bought tickets to movies with high hopes of great entertainment. Only to walk out of the theather feeling like I wasted my money and time. I watched episode after episode of tv; entire seasons infact. Just to feel like years of my life had been wasted after watching the finale.<!-- more -->

You know who you are **COUGH** **COUGH** LOST **COUGH**.

It's an unusual pairing of phrase "to spend and to waste / spent and wasted". Our American culture uses it in so many different ways.

#### Financial Transactions

> I spent 20 dollars on an amazing dinner.
>
> But wasted 14 dollars on a terrible movie.

#### Fuel

> He wasted too much fuel trying to land the craft.
>
> The engines were spent before they could break orbit.

#### Effort

> After beating the world record he looks spent.
>
> The competition wasted their effort in the prelims

And then we come to how we use this turn of phase to deal with time.

#### Time

> How did you spend your vacation?
>
> I spent it with friends and family.
>
> I wasted it watching too much TV.
>
> He spent the remainder of his days doing what he loved.

Recently, I've been focusing on the time porition of this turn of phrase.

To give you some background I used to work at a small start up. It was flush with cash trying to do it's best to get traction. I would guess you could say it was playing house. It had some compelling software but lacked the sales funnel to support the burn rate.

I spent a year working on the frontend, backend, analytics, database, messaging systems and infrastructure of what I thought was a world changing piece of software. Then the cuts began. I survived multiple rounds of layoffs and felt privaledged to be asked to say on and see this through the end. We went from a team of 24 developers and contractors to just 4. It was drastic and scary.

I was no dummy. I knew with less developers around I'd be asked to do drasticly more. I negotiated a new portion of stock options and 2 extra weeks of vacation. I also went from doing 50 hours a week to doing 80-100 hours a week. I carried a company cell phone and was on call 24-7.

This went on for another year and a half.

Then, just as I had seen saw other coleeges laid-off, I was cut just the same. Our developer team of 4 got cut to 2.  There wasn't enough runway to support 4 of us. One of the team would become the sole developer. The other would handle ops and infrastrure. The rest of us would be let go with no warning.

In retrospect, I **spent** 2 and a half years of my life. The first half at 40 hours a week and the second half at more than double that.  Honestly, I got a good salary. I got good benifits and made some great friends. Yet in the weeks following my departure I was concerned about how I spent my time.

And, in the hopes that my time was not wasted; I decided to liquidate some personal underperforming stock and convert some of my stock options. The initial thought was to make sure I didn't **waste** all of my time. If they were going to be successfull without me I wanted to see some windfall.

After all this I find it ironic that a few months after my departure I attend a stock holders meeting. Where I watched the CEO show offer features of the product that I had just finished weeks before my layoff.
